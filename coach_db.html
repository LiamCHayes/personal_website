                <p> 
                  This application, built on a MySQL database, efficiently tracks progress for each teammember on a climbing team. 
                  The database interacts with a web app built on HTML / PHP and a command line Python interface to log data.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  An accompanying R markdown document generates progress reports for each teammember with informative and easy-to-read vizualizations.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Database Structure</h1>
        <p>
            In this database there is one main table for sends (climbs that the athlete completes),
            a lookup table with information about the athlete, and a lookup table for information about 
            the zone (area of the climbing gym). Each significant completed climb is logged in the main
            database called sends with information about the send such as the coresponding athlete number, 
            zone of the send, grade, date, and whether they flashed it or not. This information can be used 
            to visualize progress and athlete performance. It can also be used to show weaknesses and areas 
            that could be improved.
        </p>

    <div  class="container climb_section">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Progress Reports</h1>
        <p>To make use of the data, there is a R Markdown document that can generate a
            progress report for each team member. All that needs to be done is to set the
            name variable at the beginning of the document to the name of the teammember.
        </p>

    <div  class="container climb_section">
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Interfaces</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are two interfaces for this database. A python command line interface
            for quick logging and an online web app for logging and fetching data. 
            They are not very polished as this was a tool that only me as a coach was using
            but I think it is a good proof of concept and easily scaled if needed.
