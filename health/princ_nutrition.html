                    <p> 
                    What you eat is a set of instructions for your body on how to live and grow. Much like any mathematical
                    model, garbage in garbage out. So, eating good information will get you a body that works well.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Main Idea</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                When nutrition is boiled down, it seems easy and simple. Eat a balanced diet of whole foods like fruit, vegetables,
                and meat. Our bodies thrive on food that closely resembles life. When we heavily process food we remove the life 
                and get food that gives us energy but nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, this is very hard to do in the western world. It is not common to cook often and when we do cook 
                we start with ingredients that are already processed. Everything around us is telling us to eat lifeless food
                and we are suffering as a result. When we think of healthy food, we think of boring, tasteless, and hard to finish. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This doesn't have to be the case, though! There are endless possibilities for foods with life! Think of authentic 
                Indian, Chinese, Italian, African, Greek, and Middle Eastern foods to name a few. These foods are full of life 
                and flavor, made from whole foods that are minimally processed. Anyone can eat a diet of these foods and 
                feel like they are living a luxurious life that is not depriving them of any food that they want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Eating in this way requires forgetting some things we've been told about healthy food in the past. The book Deep 
                Nutrition by Dr. Catherine Shanahan is an excellent resource for a deep dive in this thought change.

            <ul><b>Types of foods that I consider good:</b>
                <li>Animal products</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meat</li>
                    <li>Milk and milk products</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Organs</li>
                    <li>Connective tissue</li>
                    <li>Fat (tallow, lard, butter)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Anything that grows from the ground</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fruits</li>
                    <li>Vegetables</li>
                    <li>Beans and legumes</li>
                    <li>Nuts</li>
                    <li>Potatos</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Fermented and naturally preserved foods</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut...</li>
                    <li>Cheese, sour cream, yogurt...</li>
                    <li>Cured and dried meats (Preferably with just salt)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Oils that don't require high heat and pressure to extract</li>
                <li>Anything made from a combination of the above</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While this might seem limiting, most foods can actually be made with exclusively those ingredients. The problem 
                is that most foods available in the west are not made with those ingredients and instead are made with processed 
                and refined products. If we add bread and pasta to the list (which I think are good as long as you are consuming 
                other lively foods), the possibilities are endless.

            <p>
                Knowing how to cook makes all of this possible. By cooking with whole ingredients and reading
                labels when you can't, you are able to make delicious and healthy foods for very cheap. You can make foods 
                exactly how you like and have better quality, portions, and healthier food than restaurants. 
                However, cooking is a skill that takes time to develop and starts out with a lot of failures. 
                Patience and motivation are necessary but it is very worth it.
