                    <p> 
                    What you eat is a set of instructions for your body on how to live and grow. Much like any mathematical
                    model, garbage in garbage out. So, eating good information will get you a body that works well.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Main Idea</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                When nutrition is boiled down, it seems easy and simple. Eat a balanced diet of whole foods like fruit, vegetables,
                and meat. Our bodies thrive on food that closely resembles life. When we heavily process food we remove the life 
                and get food that gives us energy but nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, this is very hard to do in the western world. It is not common to cook often and when we do cook 
                we start with ingredients that are already processed. Everything around us is telling us to eat lifeless food
                and we are suffering as a result. When we think of healthy food, we think of boring, tasteless, and hard to finish. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This doesn't have to be the case, though! There are endless possibilities for foods with life! Think of authentic 
                Indian, Chinese, Italian, African, Greek, and Middle Eastern foods to name a few. These foods are full of life 
                and flavor, made from whole foods that are minimally processed. Anyone can eat a diet of these foods and 
                feel like they are living a luxurious life that is not depriving them of any food that they want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Eating in this way requires forgetting some things we've been told about healthy food in the past. The book Deep 
                Nutrition by Dr. Catherine Shanahan is an excellent resource that mirrors my perspective for a deep dive in this thought change. 
            </p>
            <ul><b>Types of foods that I consider good:</b>
                <li>Animal products</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meat</li>
                    <li>Milk and milk products</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Organs</li>
                    <li>Connective tissue</li>
                    <li>Fat (tallow, lard, butter)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Anything that grows from the ground</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fruits</li>
                    <li>Vegetables</li>
                    <li>Beans and legumes</li>
                    <li>Nuts</li>
                    <li>Potatos</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Fermented and naturally preserved foods</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut...</li>
                    <li>Cheese, sour cream, yogurt...</li>
                    <li>Cured and dried meats (Preferably with just salt)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Oils that don't require high heat and pressure to extract</li>
                <li>Anything made from a combination of the above</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While this might seem limiting, most foods can actually be made with exclusively those ingredients. The problem 
                is that most foods available in the west are not made with those ingredients and instead are made with processed 
                and refined products. If we add bread and pasta to the list (which I think are good as long as you are consuming 
                other lively foods), the possibilities are endless. 
            </p>

        <div class="container climb_section">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Execute</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Knowing how to cook makes all of this possible. We need to stop eating the food that's given to us and 
                start creating the food that we want to eat. By cooking with whole ingredients and reading
                labels when you can't, you are able to make delicious and healthy foods for very cheap. You can make foods 
                exactly how you like and have better quality, portions, and healthier food than restaurants. 
                However, cooking is a skill that takes time to develop and starts out with a lot of failures. 
                Patience and motivation are necessary but it is very worth it.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Developing Your Cooking Skill</h4>
            <p>
                The number one overarching piece of advice that I can give for learning how to cook is to cook more. 
                Be patient with yourself and understand that not everything will turn out good, but the average 
                deliciousness of your meals will increase over time. Look at cooking as a creative process much like
                making music or a painting. Try new things, explore your curiosity, and seek out new techniques that 
                will help you make the food you like. You'll pick up endless tricks to save time, food, and make your meals 
                taste better if you just stay persistent and try to cook more.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, there are a few ideas that I think are essential. These basics will enhance the nutritional
                value, ease, and taste of your meals as you master them. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <h5>Equipment</h5>
                <p>
                    Quality equipment that you enjoy using is a key part of cooking regularly. This depends on the person but 
                    my list of essentials is as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Big and small cutting board</li>
                        <li>Two sharp knives: Kitchen knife and pairing knife</li>
                        <li>Carbon steel frying pan</li>
                        <li>Saucepan</li>
                        <li>Enameled dutch oven</li>
                        <li>Lots of deli containers</li>
                        <li>Flat wooden spoon</li>
                        <li>Spatula</li>
                        <li>Tongs</li>
                        <li>Sieve</li>
                    </ul>
                    The type of equipment doesn't really matter. Just figure out what you like to make, get things that make that
                    easy, and build out from there.
                </p>
                <h5>Knife Skills</h5>
                <p>
                    All you need is practice! Watch some videos, make sure your knife is sharp, and try new things.
                </p>
                <h5>Stovetop Skills</h5>
                <p>
                    Similar to knife skills, all you need is practice. There are lots of videos and resources to learn this, 
                    but the important thing to remember is that it takes time and patience to develop. Some tips that 
                    help me that I don't hear mentioned much is listening to the sound of the food in the pan, getting to 
                    know the stove that you're cooking on (every stove is different), and making sure your pan is well seasoned.
                </p>
                <h5>Order of Operations</h5>
                <p>
                    Plan out the order that you do things in to be most efficient and maximize flavor. For example, cook the meat 
                    in the pan while you cut the vegetables, add the vegetables to the rendered meat fat after it is done cooking, 
                    and as the vegetables are cooking cut the fresh toppings or prepare sauces for your meal. Carbs typically take 
                    longer to cook so if you are having those, start cooking those and prep everything else as you are cooking. 
                    Don't expect yourself to get this down immediately. Develop a system that works for you and refine it over time.
                </p>
                <h5>Cleaning as you Go</h5>
                <p>
                    This makes everything so much easier. I try to have everything cleaned before I start eating. Clean when things 
                    are cooking and conserve the amount of dishes you use.
                </p>
                <h5>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</h5>
                <p>
                    Samin Nosrat did a great job generalizing the idea of cooking in her book and Netflix series Salt Fat Acid Heat. 
                    I highly recommend this if you want to be able to cook something out of anything or just make your food taste 
                    better with little upfront effort (all you have to do is watch a show or read a book).
                </p>
                <h5>Ingredient Vocabulary</h5>
                <p>
                    Be curious about new ingredients and learn how to use them. The more you know about ingredients, the more you
                    can make and the more comfortable you will feel with unfamiliar ingredients. The bigger your ingredient vocabulary, 
                    the easier cooking will be.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h4>Reading Labels</h4>
            <p>
                Some pre-made products are made from whole foods. Things that are not reasonable to make at home can be purchased at a 
                store and can be the same quality if the ingredients look good. Look for ingredients you can buy from the store yourself
                and no vegetable/canola/sunflower/safflower oils. You'll be surprised at what things contain processed and refined materials
                and what things don't! 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Managing Time</h4>
            <p>
                Know what you can make in advance and do that. I also have an arsenal of quick and easy meals that I eat during the day, 
                and then put most of my effort into cooking a delicious dinner when I have more time. You will figure out a system that 
                works for you; here's mine if you need some ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to ferment my own foods. It preserves fresh, nutrient dense foods, allows me to explore different flavors, and I don't mind the upfront
                effort. Once they're made, I have a stockpile of foods I can add to anyting. So, my easy meals for the day usually consist of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Any combination of yogurt, fermented berries, chia seeds, peanut butter, honey/agave syrup, and homemade granola</li>
                    <li>Scrambled eggs with fermented vegetables and a tortilla</li>
                    <li>Any leftovers from the night before</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I can make all of these easily and quickly. Then, once dinner rolls around, I can put more time and effort in to make something 
                    that is more complex. This is how I get variety and satisfy my cravings while saving time and eating well.
                </p>
            </p>
