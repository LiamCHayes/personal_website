                    This is my mental model for creating the conditions for a human to thrive. Genes are 
                    expressed differently depending on what the body thinks the "loss function" should be for survival. 
                    Genes affect every part about you, so optimizing for these conditions will create a healthy, 
                    happy, high-functioning, and productive life.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Primary Principles</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Unequivocally, the four most important conditions are <b>sleep</b>, <b>movement</b>, <b>nutrition</b>, and <b>mind</b>. 
                Nothing else really matters until these are dialed in. While this seems general and simple, the combined 
                power of getting these right will make an exponential difference.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Sleep</h4>
            <p>
                Good sleep will come with more movement and better nutrition, but there are still a few things that subtract 
                from sleep to be aware of. These are personal and you have to find what works best for you. 
                No matter what you do to improve sleep, everybody can benefit from making sleep a priority. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Movement</h4>
            <p>
                Similar to sleep, movement is very personal and should be prioritized. You should think about movement the 
                way you should think about food; every day you want to eat something! Don't stuff yourself, eat to a comfortable 
                level, and eat what makes you feel good. It takes time and patience to develop the skill of listening to your body 
                and the process moving every day will push you to continually do this better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another concept for people who want to be more intentional is thinking about movement as information. The movement 
                you do is <b>training data for your body</b>. Your body wants to optimize itself for what you do. This never stops, 
                whether you're sitting, running, lifting, eating, driving, or anything else. Give your body good information 
                and it will give you a capable way of interacting with the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have so many more ideas about movement that you can see in <a href="princ_movement.html">Principles of Movement</a>.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
                Food is also best thought of as information. Food is a set of instructions that tell your body how to work. 
                A piece of bread does not conatin a lot of valuable information for your body, while something like fresh 
                blueberries or a steak contains and endless set of instructions for life. It's like watching cartoons versus
                having a deep conversation with a good friend. Your mind will be much healthier and full of life after 
                the conversation as opposed to watching cartoons. 
            </p>
            <p>
                More practically, make sure you're eating good information every day. What gives you good information? You want 
                the full set of instructions, not just one step. This means avoiding refined and processed foods in favor of 
                whole foods that are closer to life. 
            </p>
            <ul><b>Foods that are full of life:</b>
                <li>Animal Products: The more it resembles the original animal the better.</li>
                <li>Fruits and Vegetables</li>
                <li>Fermented Foods: Full of biotic life and residual nutrients from the original food.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The cheapest, most practical, and most enjoyable way to eat these foods is learning how to cook. Anything that 
                you can cook at home with ingredients from the above list will give you all the instructions you need. The 
                possibilities are really endless, read more in 
                <a href="princ_nutrition.html">Principles of Nutrition</a>.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Mind</h4>
            <p>
                The mind and the body are deeply connected and just like movement, the mind needs to be used. It's important 
                to prioritize being social, intellectual pursiut, having passions, and being creative. This extends to fulfillment and meaning. 
                A hunger for learning, enjoying improvement, and creating will also keep the mind sharp and lively. This contributes valuable things to
                the world and creates a sense of purpose, which is the keystone that holds all of this together.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Afterthoughts</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                After you have dialed sleep, movement, nutrition, and mind, there are some other things that can make a difference. 
                The effects of these pale in comparison to the above four, but it is still valuable to be aware of.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Chemical Load</h4>
            <p>
                We live in a world with lots of chemicals. Some of these are neutral, some are beneficial, and some are harmful. 
                We are resilient to all of these chemicals <i>to a point</i>. The goal of reducing chemical load is not to 
                eliminate all chemicals, but to only use the ones that improve our lives. For instance, using castille soap
                made of natural oils reduces our chemical load and frees up more space to use deodorant, something that we shouldn't 
                avoid. Avoiding processed foods and plastic frees up chemical load to be more resilient to harmful 
                chemicals that we can't or don't want to avoid.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Dental Health</h4>
            <p>
                I don't know why, but this makes a big difference. 
            </p>
            <br> 

            <h4>Posture and Breathing</h4>
            <p>
                Bad posture puts unnecessary stress on the body. It can cut off blood vessels, nerves, change breathing patterns, 
                and create bad movement patterns. Breathing through the nose and with deep diaphramatic breaths will come as a result
                from truly good posture. Aside from the common posture advice, looking into PRI can incredibly level up your posture.
