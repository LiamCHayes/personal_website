                    Your body will continually adapt to what you do, all the time. Moving will allow 
                    your body to adapt to what it's supposed to do, which is move. Not to mention all of 
                    the other benefits, which are stronger bones, muscles, heart, lungs, and overall resiliency.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Main Idea</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                No matter who you are, there is something innate within you that enjoys moving. 
                The trick is to find what you enjoy and pursue improvement in that thing. Being goal 
                oriented is good, but that is not the correct foundation if your goal is lifelong health. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, enjoying what you do does not guarantee a healthy body. The good news is that most activities
                people enjoy provide improvement in the direction of health with some blind spots. So, 
                some extra goals to keep in mind are developing <b>cardiovascular fitness</b>, <b>strength and 
                bone density</b>, and <b>mobility</b>. A strong foundation in these will give you an incredibly 
                able and resilient body.
            </p>

        <div class="container climb_section">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Execute</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                As always, seek out information and strive for improvement. It doesn't matter how you develop
                these attributes, as long as you do. Movement is not a recipe, but a journey of learning and growth. 
                Do activities that make you want to continue doing those activties and everything else will follow
                if you are striving for improvement.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Cardio</h4>
            <p>
                Move around and get your heart rate up. Breathe heavy, get your blood flowing, and feel
                the endorphins you get from pushing your blood around. Cardio should feel good! It 
                doesn't have to be hard. Go on a walk, bike ride, swim, play some pickleball, or whatever 
                else gets your blood moving. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Cardio <i>can</i> be difficult, and it should be if you are trying to improve as fast as 
                possible. However, consistency is much more important than difficulty when it comes to 
                cardiovascular health. Get into the habit of doing some easy activity that moves your blood
                more than half of the days per week, preferably something that you enjoy and makes you feel good.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Strength</h4>
            <p>
                Strength is important for resiliency. Being strong means your bones are strong and muscles can output
                a lot of force. The most efficient way to develop this is through resistance training, which I recommend to 
                everybody. I realize that not everyone enjoys resistance training, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most activities make you stronger in a specific way, but there will be areas that will be underdeveloped.
                For example, running greatly improves leg strength and bone density, but the upper body doesn't get 
                much stimulus. If you don't like resistance training, I would just ask that you recognize your weaknesses 
                and do what you can to address them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Mobility</h4>
            <p>
                Mobility should be a constant. If you are not exploring your range of motion to its fullest
                extent, you're going to lose it. This is why you should find ways to use your full range of motion in 
                your daily life. Picking something up? Drop into a deep squat or stretch your hamstrings to reach the 
                ground. Watching TV? Explore ranges of motion and get to know what your body can do. Be creative and 
                appreciate the mobility that you have.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                I love working out. Movement has become one of my deepest intellectual pursits. I've probably put more effort 
                into improving my movement than I have into anything else. Through this journey, I have developed a lot 
                of ideas on how to level up. Here is my ever-evolving collection of thoughts about training to progress 
                beyond the basics.
